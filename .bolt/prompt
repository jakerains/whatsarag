For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

You must record your changes into docs/CHANGELOG.md - If this doesn't exsist, please create it. 
Document all requirements I gave you into the docs folder.
Include functional/non-functional features, implementation details, and the intended user experience as well as any other details that would be helpful.
